/*496. Next Greater Element I

You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.

Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [4,1,2], nums2 = [1,3,4,2].
Output: [-1,3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 4 in the first array, you cannot find the next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
    For number 1 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 2 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [2,4], nums2 = [1,2,3,4].
Output: [3,-1]
Explanation:
    For number 2 in the first array, the next greater number for it in the second array is 3.
    For number 4 in the first array, there is no next greater number for it in the second array, so output -1.
Note:
All elements in nums1 and nums2 are unique.
The length of both nums1 and nums2 would not exceed 1000.*/
